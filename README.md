# CS-210_Project_2
A code designed to receive banking information and output the interest that would be collected over a user specified period of time.
I believe in this particular code I have done a good job with the use of functions and my display. I could use with a little implementation of a 
class file as to compartmentalize my code as well as make it cleaner. I only had one particular problem in this code, which was nesting the for loops
and getting exactly what I wanted out of them. It took a few minutes to conceptualize but came together in the end. The use of functions and pass by reference
will help in the long run since those are used routinely. They are a lot easier to handle than pointers. In order to make this code clean I followed standard
industry practices and commented my code to increase its readability and modification potential.
